###SVGs
Changed the way I have used svg icons.

I imported my self-made icons into the icomoon app https://icomoon.io/app/ and used the resulting paths in my html and css files.  No more self-closing path elements.

###picture element
removed self-closing tags from source elements

###IDs
I've eliminated all but the one used for the off-canvas menu.

I tried to avoid all qualifying type selectors and removed most.

###Other
The beautifier seems to be adding semi-colons after closing braces!
